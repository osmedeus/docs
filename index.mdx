[Osmedeus](https://github.com/j3ssie/osmedeus) is a security focused declarative orchestration engine that simplifies complex workflow automation into auditable YAML definitions, complete with encrypted data handling, secure credential management, and sandboxed execution.

Built for both beginners and experts, it delivers powerful, composable automation without sacrificing the integrity and safety of your infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Declarative YAML Workflows** - Define pipelines with hooks, decision routing, module exclusion, and conditional branching across multiple runners (host, Docker, SSH)
- **Distributed Execution** - Redis-based master-worker pattern with queue system, webhook triggers, and file sync across workers
- **Rich Function Library** - 80+ utility functions including nmap integration, tmux sessions, SSH execution, TypeScript/Python scripting, SARIF parsing, and CDN/WAF classification
- **Event-Driven Scheduling** - Cron, file-watch, and event triggers with filtering, deduplication, and delayed task queues
- **Agentic LLM Steps** - Tool-calling agent loops with sub-agent orchestration, memory management, and structured output
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Provision and run scans across DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, Linode, and Azure with cost controls and automatic cleanup
- **Rich CLI Interface** - Interactive database queries, bulk function evaluation, workflow linting, progress bars, and comprehensive usage examples
- **REST API & Web UI** - Full API server with webhook triggers, database queries, and embedded dashboard for visualization
