Automate workflow execution with triggers.

## Trigger Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `cron` | Time-based scheduling | Daily/weekly scans |
| `event` | Event-driven execution | React to discoveries |
| `watch` | File change detection | Process new data |
| `manual` | On-demand only | Placeholder trigger |

## CLI Quick Start

The fastest way to set up scheduling, queuing, and webhooks — no YAML required.

### Schedule a Recurring Scan (`--as-cron`)

Create a cron schedule directly from the `run` command:

```bash
# Schedule a module to run daily at 2 AM
osmedeus run -m subdomain-enum -t example.com --as-cron '0 2 * * *'

# Schedule a flow to run every 6 hours
osmedeus run -f full-recon -t example.com --as-cron '0 */6 * * *'

# Schedule with additional parameters
osmedeus run -m nuclei-scan -t example.com --as-cron '0 0 * * 1' -p threads=20
```

This creates a schedule record in the database. To activate it, start the server:

```bash
osmedeus serve
```

List created schedules:

```bash
osmedeus db ls --table schedules
```

### Queue a Run for Later (`--queue`)

Queue a run for deferred processing instead of executing immediately:

```bash
# Queue a single target
osmedeus run -m subdomain-enum -t example.com --queue

# Queue multiple targets
osmedeus run -f full-recon -t example.com -t corp.com --queue

# Queue from a target file
osmedeus run -m nuclei-scan -T targets.txt --queue
```

Queued tasks are stored in the database with status `queued`. Process them with:

```bash
# Process queued tasks (one at a time)
osmedeus worker queue run

# Process with concurrency
osmedeus worker queue run --concurrency 5
```

The server also auto-polls for queued tasks when running (every 30s).

### Register a Webhook Trigger (`--as-webhook`)

Create a webhook URL that triggers a run on demand:

```bash
# Register a webhook
osmedeus run -m subdomain-enum -t example.com --as-webhook

# With an authentication key
osmedeus run -f full-recon -t example.com --as-webhook --webhook-auth-key mysecretkey
```

This creates a webhook record and prints the trigger URL. Trigger it with:

```bash
# GET request (simple trigger)
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger

# With auth key
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger?key=mysecretkey
```

Requires `enable_trigger_via_webhook: true` in `osm-settings.yaml` and a running server.

## Queue Management

Full control over queued tasks via the `osmedeus worker queue` subcommands.

### List Queued Tasks

```bash
# List all queued tasks
osmedeus worker queue list

# JSON output
osmedeus worker queue list --json
```

### Create Queued Tasks

An alternative to `--queue` on `osmedeus run`:

```bash
# Queue a flow
osmedeus worker queue new -f full-recon -t example.com

# Queue a module with multiple targets
osmedeus worker queue new -m subdomain-enum -t example.com -t corp.com

# Queue from a target file with params
osmedeus worker queue new -m nuclei-scan -T targets.txt -p threads=20
```

### Process Queued Tasks

```bash
# Start processing (polls DB every 5s)
osmedeus worker queue run

# With concurrency
osmedeus worker queue run --concurrency 5

# With a Redis connection for dual-source polling
osmedeus worker queue run --redis-url redis://localhost:6379
```

The queue runner polls the database every 5 seconds. If Redis is configured, it also listens via `BRPOP` for lower latency.

### Server-Side Queue Polling

The server (`osmedeus serve`) automatically polls for queued tasks every 30 seconds. Disable with:

```bash
osmedeus serve --no-queue-polling
```

## Webhook Management

### List Registered Webhooks

```bash
osmedeus worker webhooks
```

Displays a table of all registered webhook triggers with their UUIDs, workflow, target, trigger URL, and auth key.

### Triggering Webhooks

Webhooks can be triggered via GET or POST:

```bash
# Simple GET trigger
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger

# POST with overrides (target, flow, or module)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "other.com"}'

# Override the workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "other.com", "module": "nuclei-scan"}'
```

POST body fields (all optional — defaults come from the registered webhook):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `target` | Override the target |
| `flow` | Override with a flow workflow |
| `module` | Override with a module workflow |

### Authentication

If a webhook was registered with `--webhook-auth-key`, the key must be provided as a query parameter:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger?key=mysecretkey
```

Requests without the correct key receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Webhook Configuration

Webhook triggering must be enabled in `osm-settings.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  enable_trigger_via_webhook: true
```

## Server Flags

Relevant flags for `osmedeus serve`:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-schedule` | Disable the cron/watch/event scheduler |
| `--no-queue-polling` | Disable background queue task polling |
| `--no-event-receiver` | Disable automatic event receiver |
| `--no-hot-reload` | Disable config hot reload |

## Cron Triggers

Execute workflows on a schedule using cron expressions.

### Workflow Definition

```yaml
kind: module
name: scheduled-scan

triggers:
  - name: daily-scan
    on: cron
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"    # Daily at 2 AM
    enabled: true

params:
  - name: target
    required: true

steps:
  - name: scan
    type: bash
    command: nuclei -u {{target}}
```

### Cron Expression Format

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday = 0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Common Schedules

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| `0 2 * * *` | Daily at 2 AM |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday |
| `0 0 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |
| `0 9-17 * * 1-5` | Hourly 9-5 weekdays |

## Event Triggers

Execute workflows in response to events.

### Workflow Definition

```yaml
kind: module
name: on-asset-discovered

triggers:
  - name: new-asset
    on: event
    event:
      topic: "assets.new"
      filters:
        - "event.source == 'subfinder'"
        - "event.data.type == 'subdomain'"
    input:
      type: event_data
      field: "url"
      name: target
    enabled: true

steps:
  - name: probe
    type: bash
    command: httpx -u {{target}}
```

### Event Topics

Topics support glob patterns for flexible matching:

```yaml
event:
  topic: "assets.*"         # Matches assets.new, assets.updated
  topic: "*.new"            # Matches assets.new, vulns.new
  topic: "*"                # Matches all topics
```

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `run.started` | Workflow run started |
| `run.completed` | Workflow run completed |
| `run.failed` | Workflow run failed |
| `step.completed` | Step completed |
| `assets.new` | New asset discovered |
| `vulnerabilities.new` | New vulnerability found |

### Event Filters

JavaScript expressions to filter events:

```yaml
filters:
  - "event.source == 'nuclei'"
  - "event.data.severity == 'critical'"
  - "event.workspace == 'example.com'"
```

For advanced filtering with utility functions, use `filter_functions`:

```yaml
event:
  topic: "assets.new"
  filters:
    - "event.source == 'httpx'"
  filter_functions:
    - "contains(event.data.url, '/api/')"
    - "!ends_with(event.data.url, '.js')"
```

See [Event-Driven Triggers](event-driven.mdx) for available filter functions.

### Event Input Mapping

Two syntaxes are supported:

**New exports-style syntax (recommended):**

```yaml
input:
  target: event_data.url
  source: event.source
  description: trim(event_data.desc)
```

**Legacy syntax:**

```yaml
input:
  type: event_data
  field: "target"      # Field in event data
  name: target         # Workflow parameter name
```

### Event Template Variables

Event-triggered workflows have access to these template variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{EventEnvelope}}` | Full JSON event envelope |
| `{{EventTopic}}` | Event topic |
| `{{EventSource}}` | Event source |
| `{{EventDataType}}` | Data type |
| `{{EventTimestamp}}` | Event timestamp |

## Watch Triggers

Execute workflows when files change. Uses fsnotify for instant inotify-based file system notifications.

### Workflow Definition

```yaml
kind: module
name: process-new-targets

triggers:
  - name: new-targets
    on: watch
    path: "/data/targets/"
    debounce: "500ms"    # Optional: debounce rapid changes
    input:
      type: file_path
      name: target_file
    enabled: true

steps:
  - name: process
    type: foreach
    input: "{{target_file}}"
    variable: target
    step:
      type: bash
      command: scan {{target}}
```

### Watch Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Directory or file path to watch |
| `debounce` | string | Optional debounce duration (e.g., "500ms", "1s", "2s") |

### Debounce

When files are modified rapidly (e.g., during a write operation), multiple events may fire. Use `debounce` to consolidate rapid changes into a single trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: watch-logs
    on: watch
    path: "/var/log/scan-results/"
    debounce: "1s"    # Wait 1 second after last change before triggering
    enabled: true
```

The debounce timer resets on each new file event. The workflow only triggers after the specified duration has passed without new events.

### Watch Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `create` | New file created |
| `modify` | File modified |
| `delete` | File deleted |
| `rename` | File renamed |

## API Management

### List Schedules

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Create Schedule

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "daily-scan",
    "workflow_name": "full-recon",
    "trigger_type": "cron",
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *",
    "input_config": {
      "target": "example.com"
    },
    "is_enabled": true
  }'
```

### Enable/Disable

```bash
# Enable
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules/sched-123/enable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Disable
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules/sched-123/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Trigger Manually

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules/sched-123/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Delete Schedule

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules/sched-123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Webhook API Endpoints

List registered webhooks (authenticated):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Trigger a webhook (unauthenticated, unless `webhook_auth_key` is set):

```bash
# GET
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger

# POST with overrides
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/osm/api/webhook-runs/<uuid>/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "other.com", "module": "nuclei-scan"}'
```

## Combined Triggers

A workflow can have multiple triggers:

```yaml
kind: module
name: flexible-scan

triggers:
  # Run daily
  - name: daily
    on: cron
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    enabled: true

  # Run on new assets
  - name: on-asset
    on: event
    event:
      topic: "assets.new"
    input:
      type: event_data
      field: "url"
      name: target
    enabled: true

  # Manual trigger placeholder
  - name: manual
    on: manual
    enabled: true

params:
  - name: target
    required: true

steps:
  - name: scan
    type: bash
    command: scan {{target}}
```

## Event Emission

Emit events from workflows:

```yaml
- name: scan
  type: bash
  command: nuclei -u {{target}} -o {{Output}}/vulns.json
  on_success:
    - action: emit_event
      topic: "scan.completed"
      data:
        target: "{{target}}"
        results: "{{Output}}/vulns.json"
```

## Database Storage

Schedules are stored in the database:

```sql
-- schedules table
id, name, workflow_name, workflow_path, trigger_type,
schedule, event_topic, watch_path, input_config,
is_enabled, last_run, next_run, run_count,
created_at, updated_at
```

Query schedules:
```bash
osmedeus db query "SELECT * FROM schedules WHERE is_enabled = true"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive trigger names**
2. **Start with disabled triggers** during testing
3. **Set reasonable intervals** to avoid overload
4. **Use event filters** to reduce noise
5. **Monitor trigger execution** via event logs
6. **Combine with distributed mode** for scale

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule not running

```bash
# Check if enabled
curl http://localhost:8002/osm/api/schedules/sched-123

# Check next_run time
# Ensure server is running
```

### Events not triggering

```bash
# Check event logs
curl "http://localhost:8002/osm/api/event-logs?topic=assets.new"

# Verify filter expressions
```

### Watch not detecting changes

```bash
# Verify path exists
# Check file permissions
# Ensure pattern matches
```
