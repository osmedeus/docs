A collection of frequently asked questions along with explanations of common errors and how to resolve them.

## 1. General

<ResponseField name="What is Osmedeus?">
  <Expandable title="Answer">
    Osmedeus is a workflow engine for security automation. It executes YAML-defined workflows with support for multiple execution environments (host, Docker, SSH), scheduling, and distributed scanning.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="What are the system requirements?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
  The Osmedeus core engine is lightweight and can run anywhere with almost any specs. <br />
  
  However, if you plan to use it for **reconnaissance** (which is the main use case), it is recommended to use a modern Linux, macOS, or Windows system with WSL. <br />

  Since running reconnaissance generates heavy network traffic, it is also recommended to run Osmedeus in a cloud environment, **such as a VM, Compute Engine, or EC2**, to achieve the best performance.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How do I install Osmedeus?">
  <Expandable title="Answer">
    ```bash
    # Build from source
    make build

    # Install to $GOBIN
    make install

    # Install security tools
    osmedeus install binary --all
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## 2. Binary Installation

<ResponseField name="Why do I need to install external binary?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
Osmedeus is a standalone Golang binary and works perfectly fine on its own. However, when using Osmedeus to run YAML workflows for security automation, it often needs to call external tools like `httpx, nuclei, ffuf, etc`. These tools must be installed and available on your system for those workflows to function properly.
 </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="I encountered an error when installing the binary or running `osmedeus health`. What should I do?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
Not all binaries listed in the registry are required for every workflow. Your scans may still function correctly even if some tools are missing.
 </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Do I need to install all the binaries in the registry using `osmedeus install binary --all --install-optional` ?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
No. Installing all tools is completely optional. The registry includes additional tools that are commonly used in YAML workflows, but you only need the ones required for your specific workflow. Installing everything is not necessary for running a basic workflow.
 </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="I tried everything I can but still haven't managed to install the required binaries. What should I do?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
Like I said above, not all binaries listed in the registry are required for every workflow. Your scans may still function correctly even if some tools are missing.

If you would like the ideal setup then I recommend using Docker to run Osmedeus and its workflows. This ensures that all dependencies are met and eliminates any compatibility issues. See the [Docker Setup](/getting-started/docker-setup) for more details.

## 3. Scan Execution & Scanning Results

<ResponseField name="How do I run a basic scan?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    ```bash
    # Run a flow workflow
    osmedeus run -f general -t example.com

    # Run a module workflow
    osmedeus run -m vulnerability-scan -t example.com
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How do I scan multiple targets?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    ```bash
    # From command line
    osmedeus run -f fast -t target1.com -t target2.com

    # From file
    osmedeus run -f fast -T targets.txt -c 5
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How do I set a timeout?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    ```bash
    osmedeus run -m port-scan -t example.com --timeout 2h
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Where are scan results stored?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Results are stored in workspaces at `~/workspaces-osmedeus/<target>/`.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Where should I put my token (Github, Shodan, etc)?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    All you need to do is follow [**this guide to setup the token**](/getting-started/basic-setup/)
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How can I setup to send notification?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    All you need to do is follow [**this guide to setup notification**](/advanced/notification-and-cdn/)
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Where I can get a live support?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    You can Join **`https://discord.gg/mtQG2FQsYA`** to see if anyone can help. I might answer from time to time but I couldn't promise to answer every single of them.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Does it support Proxy?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Nope, natively it doesn't support proxy. But since the design of the tool is running other 3rd party tools and a lot of them don't support proxy by default. I've already considered proxychains but it makes it extremely slow and breaks a lot of things.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Why was my scan stuck at portscan?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    It will stay there because it got a sudo password prompt. Some special tools require *root* permission to run like **nmap**. Make sure you allow **nmap** can be run without sudo password prompt.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Why did my scan such as vulnerability scanning, port scanning, or content discovery take so long?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    It's probably because the thing you put in was really big. Think about trying to run the content discovery against **2000 different hosts**. That's why it takes a long time.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Why Osmedeus didn't find any vulnerability even when I scan it with the intentionally vulnerable app?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Again it very much depends on your target. Osmedeus really shines on large scope targets, not the single intentionally vulnerable web app. Just scan some random VDP then you will see the result.
    The reason it won't find any vulnerability on the intentionally vulnerable app is the **vulnscan** module won't support it. But you're always welcome to customize the workflow to do so.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="I found a new tool that is pretty awesome. Can you add it in Osmedeus?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Yes, just follow [**this guide**](/advanced/writing-your-first-workflow/) to add it to your workflow.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Does the X scan run tool Y or not?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    1. Read the flow and module files to determine what a step actually runs
    2. Seriously, read the flow and module files.
    3. Remember that you were warned twice about reading the flow and module files.
    4. Search for the tool command in the workflow folder to confirm whether it is used or not (e.g: `rg -F 'nuclei' ~/osmedeus-base/workflows/`)
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Where can I find the password for the Web UI?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Please refer to [**this page**](/getting-started/web-ui/) to start a web server and get credentials. You may need to run this command `osmedeus config view server.password`
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How can I keep the scan or the web UI running in the background?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    The simplest way to do it is running the process under `https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/` . Other than that you can setup a service to run the osmedeus web server as a background process.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="What should I do if Osmedeus found a vulnerability X?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    1. Read the vulnerability X description.
    2. Seriously, read the vulnerability X description.
    3. Remember that you were warned twice about reading the vulnerability X description.
    4. Search for that vulnerability X name.
    5. Manually verify the vulnerability X.
    6. Still no results? maybe `https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=what+is+a+vulnerability+X`  can help you.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Osmedeus found some vulnerable subdomains, but I am unable to access them?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    It is often the case that the availability of a subdomain found during a scan may not be the same when you attempt to manually verify it. This depends on the target and can vary.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="When I run with the `--debug` flag, I've noticed that certain commands are returning errors with exit statuses such as 128, 255, or -1. Is this to be expected?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    Yes, it's normal for certain commands to exhibit expected exit statuses, as they may succeed under specific conditions. However, if you're confident that the raw bash command should succeed but is failing, please try copying the raw bash command and investigate why it's encountering issues.
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="How can I determine which workflow to run for my target?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    You can run `osmedeus workflow ls` or `osmedeus workflow show <workflow-name> --verbose` to see the description and that would fit to the scan
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="The scan executed without issues, but the UI doesn't display any assets?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
    This is likely due to the fact that the workflow you executed did not generate any assets. You can verify this by checking the workspace directory located at `~/workspaces-osmedeus/<target>/` to see if any files were created.

    It is also because the workflow doesn't use any database utility function to save the assets into the database. You can check the workflow file to see if it uses any database utility functions like `db_import_asset`. You can also see the full list of database related function at `osmedeus func ls db --example`
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Why I didn't see any notification even when I setup the ?">
  <Expandable title="Answer" defaultOpen="true">
  This is likely due to the fact that the workflow you executed did not generate any assets. You can verify this by checking the workspace directory located at `~/workspaces-osmedeus/<target>/` to see if any files were created.

  It is also because the workflow doesn't use any notification utility function to save the assets into the notification. You can check the workflow file to see if it uses any notification utility functions like `notify_telegram`.
