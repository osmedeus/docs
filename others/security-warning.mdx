<Warning>
**Important:** Osmedeus is a powerful security automation tool designed to execute code on your machine. Please read this document carefully before using Osmedeus in any environment.
</Warning>

## Overview

Osmedeus is intentionally designed as a workflow execution engine that runs arbitrary commands and scripts. This design is fundamental to its purpose as a security automation tool. However, this power comes with inherent security risks that users must understand and mitigate.

This document outlines the security considerations, potential risks, and best practices for safely using Osmedeus.

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Web UI and API Server

The Osmedeus Web UI and REST API provide interfaces for:

- Creating and executing new scans
- Running utility functions
- Managing workflows and schedules
- Accessing scan results and artifacts

**Risks:**
- Unauthorized access could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on your system
- Exposed APIs without authentication can be exploited for remote code execution
- Default credentials pose a significant security risk

**Recommendations:**
- Always use strong, unique credentials for API authentication. Use the following commands to set secure random credentials:

```bash
osmedeus config set server.password "$(openssl rand -hex 12)"
osmedeus config set server.jwt.secret_signing_key "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
osmedeus config set server.auth_api_key "$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
```

- Never expose the API server to the public internet without proper authentication
- Use the `--no-auth` flag only in isolated development environments
- Consider using API keys with limited permissions
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy with TLS encryption
- Implement network-level access controls (firewall rules, VPN)

### 2. YAML Workflow Files

YAML workflow files are the core of Osmedeus automation. They can contain:

- Shell commands (`bash` steps)
- JavaScript function calls (`function` steps)
- Remote execution commands (`remote-bash` steps)
- HTTP requests (`http` steps)

**Risks:**
- Malicious workflows can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Osmedeus process
- Third-party workflows may contain hidden malicious code
- Workflows can access the filesystem, network, and other system resources

**Recommendations:**
- **Never run untrusted or unverified workflow files**
- Always review workflow YAML files before execution
- Use `osmedeus workflow validate <name>` to check workflow syntax
- Store workflows in version-controlled repositories
- Implement workflow signing or checksums for verification
- Run Osmedeus with minimal required privileges

<Note>
This is similar to other workflow engines such as Apache Airflow, Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins. Allowing users to execute arbitrary workflows is inherent to their design.
</Note>

### 3. External Binary Installation

The `osmedeus install` command downloads and installs binaries from external sources:

- Security tools (nuclei, httpx, subfinder, etc.)
- Workflow files from remote repositories

**Risks:**
- Downloaded binaries could be compromised or malicious
- Man-in-the-middle attacks during downloads
- Supply chain attacks on upstream tool repositories

**Recommendations:**
- Only install binaries from trusted sources
- Verify checksums when available
- Consider using the Nix-based installation for reproducible builds
- Review the binary registry before installing new tools
- Keep installed tools updated to patch known vulnerabilities

### 4. Database and Storage

Osmedeus stores scan results, credentials, and configuration data:

**Risks:**
- Sensitive data exposure through database access
- Unencrypted storage of credentials
- Backup file exposure

**Recommendations:**
- Secure database access with strong authentication
- Encrypt sensitive configuration values
- Implement proper backup encryption
- Regularly audit stored data for sensitive information
- Use PostgreSQL with TLS for production deployments

## Best Practices Summary

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Authentication | Use strong credentials, enable API keys, rotate regularly |
| Network | Use TLS, firewall rules, VPN for remote access |
| Workflows | Review before execution, use version control, validate syntax |
| Binaries | Verify sources, check signatures, use Nix when possible |
| Privileges | Run with minimal permissions, use dedicated service accounts |
| Monitoring | Enable logging, audit access, monitor for anomalies |
| Updates | Keep Osmedeus and tools updated with security patches |
